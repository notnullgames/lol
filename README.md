# Legend of [Luser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luser)

This is a game made in godot. It's an action-adventure game, sort of like Zelda, but with a hacker theme.

> Internet slang prior to the popularization of the Internet in the late 1990s, defined a luser (sometimes expanded to local user; also luzer or luzzer) as a painfully annoying, stupid, or irritating computer user. The word is a blend of "loser" and "user". Among hackers, the word luser takes on a broad meaning, referring to any normal user (in other words, not a "guru"), with the implication the person is also a loser. The term is partially interchangeable with the hacker term lamer.

The fonts are a bit glitchy on the web, but look good on local build, so it's just a sort of idea of how it's progressing.
